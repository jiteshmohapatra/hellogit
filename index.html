    <h1 class="c1">Our Environment comprises three components â€“ natural components (air, water, land & living things), human components (individual, family, community), and human-made components (roads, monuments, industries),</h1>
    <p class="c2">The Natural Environment could be further classified into four domains- lithosphere, Hydrosphere, Biosphere, and Atmosphere. These are also called the domains of the environment. The top layer of the Earth or the solid crust is called the lithosphere. It is covered by a thin layer of soil and is formed of rocks and minerals.</p>
